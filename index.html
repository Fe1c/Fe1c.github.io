        <h2>Interesting Fact:</h2>
        <p>
            To most, the most interesting fact about me is that I came from a highschool of less than 50 students, and was the only 
            student in my entire class to go on to a four-year university. Out where I came from, I didnt even had high speed internet 
            until I got unil high school, but in that short time I grew an interest in computers to the point where I though going 
            to school to learn about them was a good idea and something I wanted to do.
