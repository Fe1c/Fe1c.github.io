            The main troubles that I encountered when writing my first CS290 website was mainly just snytatic ones, I had never written HTML before
            and this was my first experince useing the language. I learned that the language is quite easy. I used the lecture notes to learned
            the syntax of the HTML, then I just wrot the website in a way I though looked nice and was organized.
